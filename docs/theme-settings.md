### Selecting a Theme

1. **Open Theme Settings**: Click on the "Settings" tab in the side navigation bar to open the theme settings.
2. **Theme Options**: A small box appears, presenting a few theme options:

   - **Default**: The standard theme.
   - **Moonlight**: A cooler, more subdued theme.
   - **Dark Angel**: A darker, high-contrast theme.

### Applying and Saving a Theme

1. **Preview Theme Change**: Users can see the changes in the theme immediately after selecting an option. This allows them to preview the theme before finalizing their choice.
2. **Persisting Changes**: The selected theme will not persist after a page refresh unless the user clicks "Save." Clicking "Save" ensures that the chosen theme is applied consistently across sessions.
