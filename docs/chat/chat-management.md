# Chat Management

Document-Copilotâ€™s chat management features provide users with tools to efficiently create, access, and manage their chat sessions. This section covers how to start new chats and manage previous chat histories.

### New Chat Icon

- **Create New Chat**: Click on the new chat icon in the navigation bar to start a fresh conversation. This action opens a blank chat window, allowing you to begin a new query without any previous context.
